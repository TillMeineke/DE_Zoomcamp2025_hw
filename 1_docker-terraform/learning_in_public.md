## Week 1: Docker and Terraform

- [x] Learning in Public 1: Intro [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tillmeineke_github-datatalksclubdata-engineering-zoomcamp-activity-7289809118872178689-EpXQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on 28 January 2025

🎉 Just started Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 with Data Talks Club! 🚀

Excited to begin this 4-month journey into modern data engineering. Here’s what’s ahead:

🐳 Docker & SQL fundamentals  
🔄 Workflow orchestration with Kestra  
📊 Data warehousing with AWS Redshift  
🛠 DBT for transformations  
⚡ Batch processing  
🌊 Stream processing  

The best part? We’re learning in public! The course team (Alexey Grigorev, Michael Shoemaker, MBA, Bruno Oliveira, and others) emphasized how sharing our journey helps deepen understanding and build connections.
Taking on an extra challenge by implementing everything in AWS instead of GCP! While the course uses GCP, I’m excited to adapt the concepts to AWS services. Working with real NYC Taxi data, this hands-on experience promises to be transformative. Can’t wait to build my first end-to-end data pipeline!

Want to join the learning journey? The course is free and open source! Check out: <https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp>

PS: #MLzoomcamp ist still running, but I already passed my second project. Certification will come in February.

🎉 Week 1 Progress Update: Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025! 🚀

Thanks to my previous ML Zoomcamp experience with Docker, the first week of DE Zoomcamp was a smooth sailing! Here’s what we covered:

🐳 Docker Mastery:

- Containerized Postgres and pgAdmin
- Set up a complete local development environment
- Created an automated ingestion pipeline for NYC Taxi data

🔗 Docker-Compose Magic:

- Connected multiple services seamlessly
- Managed environment variables effectively
- Learned proper networking and port mapping

🏗️ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:

- Learned declarative infrastructure management
- Set up cloud resources with code instead of clicking buttons
- Practiced infrastructure versioning and state management

💡 Key Takeaway: The ML Zoomcamp foundation really paid off! While the course uses GCP, I’m adapting everything to AWS for an extra challenge. Terraform’s multi-cloud capabilities make this possible without major rewrites!

🚀 Week 1 module 3: Adapting GCP Terraform Setup to AWS hashtag#DEZoomcamp

Just finished watching today’s lesson on GCP Terraform setup. While I haven’t implemented the AWS version yet, here’s my planned adaptation approach:

🔑 Key Steps to Implement:

- Set up AWS provider configuration in Terraform
- Create S3 bucket for state management
- Establish secure IAM roles and permissions

💡 Best Practices I’ll follow:

- Never store credentials in Terraform files
- Implement proper resource tagging from the start
- Follow modular structure for reusability
- Use environment variables for AWS credentials

🛠️ Setup Needed:

- AWS CLI configuration
- Terraform installation
- VS Code with HashiCorp extension
- Git repository with proper .gitignore

Will be working on this adaptation later this week. Really appreciate that DataTalksClub provides an AWS-specific SLACK channel for students following along with AWS instead of GCP!

Next up: Creating AWS-specific Terraform configurations and implementing proper state management!
